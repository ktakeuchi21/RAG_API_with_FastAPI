{"id":"med_core_001","doc_type":"overview","title":"What Medicare is and who it is for","text":"Medicare is a federal health insurance program primarily for people age 65 and older, as well as some people under 65 with qualifying disabilities or medical conditions. Medicare coverage is individual-based, not family-based. Eligibility is generally tied to age, disability status, or specific diagnoses, and enrollment timing matters. Most people must actively make decisions when first becoming eligible.","tags":["basics","eligibility"]}

{"id":"med_core_002","doc_type":"overview","title":"The four main parts of Medicare","text":"Medicare is divided into four parts. Part A covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice, and limited home health services. Part B covers outpatient medical care such as doctor visits, preventive services, diagnostics, and durable medical equipment. Part D covers prescription drugs through private plans. Part C, also called Medicare Advantage, is an alternative way to receive Part A and Part B benefits through private insurers, often bundling Part D and extra benefits.","tags":["parts","structure"]}

{"id":"med_core_003","doc_type":"eligibility","title":"Who typically qualifies for Medicare","text":"Most people qualify for Medicare at age 65. Some people qualify earlier due to long-term disability or specific medical conditions. Medicare eligibility is individual, meaning spouses enroll separately even if they are the same age. Eligibility does not depend on income, although income can affect premiums for some parts. Enrollment timing and how you enroll can affect lifetime costs.","tags":["eligibility","age","disability"]}

{"id":"med_enroll_001","doc_type":"enrollment","title":"Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) explained","text":"The Initial Enrollment Period is the first opportunity most people have to enroll in Medicare. It generally lasts seven months: the three months before the month you turn 65, your birthday month, and the three months after. Enrolling earlier in the IEP can help ensure coverage starts on time. Missing this window may lead to coverage gaps or penalties unless another enrollment period applies.","tags":["enrollment","IEP"]}

{"id":"med_enroll_002","doc_type":"enrollment","title":"Special Enrollment Periods (SEP) and work-based coverage","text":"A Special Enrollment Period may apply if you delay Medicare because you or your spouse are actively working and covered by job-based insurance. When that coverage ends, you may have a limited window to enroll in certain parts of Medicare without penalties. This SEP is tied to active employment coverage, not retiree coverage or COBRA. Understanding whether coverage counts as active employment coverage is critical.","tags":["enrollment","SEP","employer"]}

{"id":"med_enroll_003","doc_type":"enrollment","title":"General Enrollment Period (GEP) and late enrollment consequences","text":"If you miss your Initial Enrollment Period and do not qualify for a Special Enrollment Period, you may have to wait for the General Enrollment Period. Coverage generally starts later, and permanent late enrollment penalties may apply to certain parts of Medicare. These penalties can increase monthly premiums for life, making enrollment timing a critical decision.","tags":["enrollment","GEP","penalties"]}

{"id":"med_decision_001","doc_type":"decision","title":"The first big Medicare decision: Original Medicare vs Medicare Advantage","text":"One of the most important Medicare decisions is whether to choose Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage. Original Medicare consists of Part A and Part B, often paired with Part D and possibly a Medigap supplement. Medicare Advantage replaces Original Medicare with a private plan that manages care through a network. This choice affects provider access, cost structure, flexibility, and how care is delivered.","tags":["decision","original_vs_advantage"]}

{"id":"med_original_001","doc_type":"pathway","title":"Original Medicare: how it works","text":"Original Medicare allows you to see any provider nationwide who accepts Medicare. There are no provider networks, and referrals are generally not required. You typically pay cost sharing such as deductibles and coinsurance. Because Original Medicare has no annual out-of-pocket maximum, many people pair it with supplemental coverage to reduce financial risk.","tags":["original_medicare","flexibility"]}

{"id":"med_medigap_001","doc_type":"pathway","title":"Medigap (Medicare Supplement) explained","text":"Medigap policies are private insurance plans that help cover some of the cost sharing left by Original Medicare, such as deductibles and coinsurance. Medigap plans generally work nationwide and do not require provider networks. Enrollment timing matters, as guaranteed issue rights are limited. Medigap does not include prescription drug coverage, so Part D is typically needed separately.","tags":["medigap","supplement"]}

{"id":"med_advantage_001","doc_type":"pathway","title":"Medicare Advantage: how it works","text":"Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurers and replace Original Medicare. They typically use provider networks such as HMOs or PPOs, may require referrals, and often include extra benefits like vision, dental, hearing, or fitness programs. Medicare Advantage plans have an annual out-of-pocket maximum but restrict care to network rules except in emergencies.","tags":["medicare_advantage","networks"]}

{"id":"med_tradeoff_001","doc_type":"comparison","title":"Original Medicare vs Medicare Advantage: key tradeoffs","text":"Original Medicare offers maximum provider flexibility and nationwide access but may involve higher and less predictable out-of-pocket costs unless supplemented. Medicare Advantage often has lower premiums and extra benefits but limits provider choice and requires navigating plan rules. People who travel frequently, see specialists across systems, or value flexibility often lean toward Original Medicare. People who prioritize lower premiums and bundled benefits may lean toward Medicare Advantage.","tags":["comparison","tradeoffs"]}

{"id":"med_partd_001","doc_type":"pathway","title":"Part D prescription drug coverage basics","text":"Part D plans cover prescription drugs and are offered by private insurers. Each plan has its own formulary, pharmacy network, and cost-sharing structure. Formularies can change annually, and drugs may require prior authorization or step therapy. Choosing a Part D plan should be based on your current medications rather than premiums alone.","tags":["part_d","prescriptions"]}

{"id":"med_rx_decision_001","doc_type":"decision","title":"How to choose a Part D plan using your medications","text":"To choose a Part D plan, list your medications with dosage and frequency, then compare plans based on whether drugs are covered, what tier they are on, which pharmacies are preferred, and total estimated annual cost. A plan with a higher premium may be cheaper overall if it covers expensive medications better. Formularies and pharmacy networks are often the biggest drivers of cost.","tags":["part_d","decision"]}

{"id":"med_costs_001","doc_type":"costs","title":"Understanding Medicare costs and budgeting","text":"Medicare costs can include premiums, deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Some parts have standard premiums, while others vary by plan. Costs also depend on utilization and whether supplemental coverage is chosen. Budgeting for Medicare involves estimating predictable premiums and planning for potential out-of-pocket exposure.","tags":["costs","budgeting"]}

{"id":"med_coordination_001","doc_type":"special","title":"Medicare and employer coverage coordination","text":"If you have employer coverage at age 65, how Medicare coordinates with that coverage depends on employer size and whether coverage is from active employment. In some cases Medicare pays first; in others, employer coverage does. Choosing whether to delay enrollment in Part B requires careful analysis to avoid penalties and coverage gaps.","tags":["coordination","employer"]}

{"id":"med_mistakes_001","doc_type":"pitfalls","title":"Common Medicare mistakes and how to avoid them","text":"Common mistakes include missing enrollment windows, assuming Medicare covers everything, choosing a plan based only on premiums, not checking provider networks or formularies, and misunderstanding Medigap enrollment rights. Avoid these by planning early, comparing options based on actual usage, and confirming details through official channels.","tags":["mistakes","pitfalls"]}

{"id":"med_followup_001","doc_type":"intake","title":"Key follow-up questions to ask Medicare users","text":"Important follow-up questions include: Are you turning 65 soon or already eligible?

Do you prefer predictable costs or lower premiums?","tags":["intake","questions"]}

{"id":"med_scen_001","doc_type":"scenario","title":"Scenario: turning 65 while still working","text":"A person turning 65 who is still working and covered by employer insurance must decide whether to enroll in Medicare now or delay. The key factors are whether the employer coverage counts as active employment coverage, employer size, and whether delaying Part B will preserve a penalty-free enrollment window later.","tags":["scenario","working_65"]}

{"id":"med_scen_002","doc_type":"scenario","title":"Scenario: retiring at 65 with chronic conditions","text":"A retiree with chronic conditions may prioritize provider flexibility and predictable costs.
